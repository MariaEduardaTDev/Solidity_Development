# 🌐 Solidity Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my continuous path in mastering **Solidity** and **Web3 development**.  
Each project here represents a step toward understanding how decentralized systems work — from the logic of smart contracts to the philosophy of open, trustless technology.

I deeply believe in the potential of **Web3 to reshape digital ownership, identity, and collaboration**, and this space reflects my journey to become part of that transformation.

## 🎯 Purpose

To build a strong, practical foundation in smart contract development — exploring both the technical and conceptual sides of decentralized technology.  
Here I learn by doing, experiment, break things, and rebuild them better.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a developer in training — curious, persistent, and passionate about building the next generation of the internet through blockchain.  
For me, **Web3 isn’t just a technology — it’s a mindset** about transparency, ownership, and collaboration.

This repository is where I document that learning journey — line by line, block by block.
