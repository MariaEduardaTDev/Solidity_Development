# Solidity Learning Journey

This repository documents my path in learning Solidity â€” the language behind smart contracts and Web3 applications.
Each project here represents a step toward understanding how decentralized systems work from the inside out.

My focus is not just on writing code, but on grasping the logic, structure, and security principles that make blockchain reliable.

## Purpose

To build a strong foundation in smart contract development, exploring both the technical and conceptual sides of decentralized technology.
This is where I practice, make mistakes, and grow through experimentation.

## Areas of Study

- Smart contract structure and security

- Common ERC standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)

- Gas optimization and best practices

- Interactions between contracts and Web3 integrations

- DeFi concepts and automation

## About Me

Iâ€™m a developer in training, passionate about blockchain, decentralization, and digital trust.
This space reflects my growth â€” line by line, learning by doing.
